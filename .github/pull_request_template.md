General guidance

- Generally, approve a PR if it makes the system better, even if it's not perfect. ‚Äî [Google: The Standard of Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)
- The aim of both PR AUTHOR and PR REVIEWER is to get the code merged
- Aim for consensus, defined as _everyone can live with the outcome_

For PR REVIEWER:

1. Read the ticket & description
2. [Review the code](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html)
3. Request any changes that are essential.
4. For non-essential comments:
   - Use prefixes, e.g. "**nit:** change to Pascal case"
     - **nit:** small, non-essential change
     - **obs:** just an observation, doesn't affect the PR
     - **idea:** a suggestion to think about
     - **q:** questions
   - Use modifiers, e.g. "**obs**`[pr-owner-resolve]`: Jim is also editing this file"
     - `pr-author-resolve` PR author can resolve after reading
     - `pr-author-delete` (rare) delete after reading to avoid confusion
5. try to add _at least_ a helpful comment per ~500 lines; less if the PR is already busy

For PR AUTHOR:

1. Aim for enough detail in PR description for things to go smoothly
2. After requested changes, [re-request a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#re-requesting-a-review) (so the PR shows up in [reviews-requested:@me](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review-requested%3A%40me+))
